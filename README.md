STM-Example (by Shen Ting Ang)

An example R file that shows how various STM functions are used. The stm package can be found at http://structuraltopicmodel.com/ and contains much more comprehensive instructions. This file is mainly for beginners to quick start into a workflow that suits most basic analysis needs.

An original template was provided by Molly Roberts. Some refinements in the code were originally proposed by Gerald Yong.
